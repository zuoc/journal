# Soul Purpose

Kundalini is Rising, from the base of my spine to far beyond imagination

Reaching deep into the farthest reaches of the cosmos, into the web of human history, mystery, all things previous and sacred, and what a privilege it is, witnessing the act of creation itself

My Caduceus, the two serpents weaving the key to truth throughout the ages, heals all, and it's weight is immense — yet it is light as a feather

the sword of truth, programming the minds of centuries and yugas beyond — into the deepest portals of mine soul
