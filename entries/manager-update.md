<insert manager's name here>,

As I mentioned in our last 1:1, I have (a typically very well controlled and balanced) bipolar disorder. I’ve had a very successful year, thus far, and am honestly very proud of the balance I’ve maintained in 2017. It requires increasing amounts of self-awareness and psychological mechanisms that I’ve cultivated over the past several years, and I feel as though I’ve exercised them, successfully, to the best of my ability.

Unfortunately, there appears to be a component to this disorder that is beyond self-remedy and therefore my direct control — and I fear that this is what is affecting me now, today. 

Over the past several weeks, my mental health has appeared, to me, to slowly be deteriorating, and I feel as though I am passing a threshold point. So, I’m sending this note to you in the spirit of transparency. I’ve done all that I can to avoid needing to write this email, but I think the time has come.

## Today

Psychologically, I feel very well and am proud of my current state, despite neurochemical adversity. Neurologically, however, I do not feel well at all. Something beyond the scope of levers like self-awareness is affecting me profoundly right now, and I think, despite the fact that I presently feel psychologically sound (psyche is what historically has been thrown off balance), that I am actually not doing well, overall. Some other aspect is quite out of balance, in a life-affecting manner. My guess is that neurochemistry going through a heavy manic cycle, but I have maintained psychological balance throughout the process, and am therefore few typical symptoms are manifesting. So, yay?

In other words, I feel as though I’m presently experiencing acute mania without any of the psychological symptomologies present.

## Next Steps

My doctor is unavailable until September, but I’m going to see if I can get him on the phone for a few minutes today. 

I feel I need to take the rest of the week off. It would also be foolish of me to travel to New York next week (I haven’t booked travel yet, so no expense will be lost to the company). I know we’re planning on having a team hurrah, and I’d hate to miss that — but I really feel like it would be irresponsible for me to go, given my current condition.

I am hoping that removing variables for a few days will assist my neurology in mending itself. I’m about to take an antipsychotic, which I use only in “emergencies”, despite exhibiting no psychotic features, in an attempt to, well, feel better and get back on my feet.

Some potentially helpful information:

- I’ve experienced mania that required hospitalization three times.
- These breakdowns have occurred in a yearly cycle — during this season — for the past three years.
- Each time it occurs, there is significantly less (I’d guess 1/10th) personal and interpersonal impact present. I’m really hoping to avoid this whole thing entirely this year, and all signs point to yes — I think that taking a few days will help reduce the chances of relapse.
- I’m sleeping less and less each night, unable to sleep longer. Last night I slept for a total of three hours. This is what is promoting me to reach out.

I would have given a heads up sooner about this, but I thought that since I now know how to maintain psychological balance, that this cycle would be avoided entirely. But, as discussed above, there appear to be components of this cycle that extend beyond the psyche.

I’m hoping this will pass very quickly and I’m confident that my psyche is protected from the mental traps I’ve fallen into in the past:

Thank you so much for listening, and I appreciate your understanding. I understand this is not a typical email to receive (including the style of language used), but I am sending it with the best of intentions, after much though and consideration. In other words, I wouldn’t be sending this if I didn’t need to.

There’s no need to be concerned, I’m sure I’ll feel balanced again in a few days. I apologize for the verbosity as well, but I feel it is helpful in situations like this.

Anyway, thanks again for your time. I’ll talk to you very soon.

All the best,

Kenneth Reitz
