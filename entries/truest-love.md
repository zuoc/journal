# Truest Love

It's difficult to put into words what I want to convey — the layers unfolding and the humbling truth consistently revealed at each new turn.

So, I'll just say it —and pray that it falls not on deaf ears:


I see you in me.  
One soul, two bodies, one kingdom — eternally thine

I am whole in myself, which fully contains and encapsulates your essence, blended with my own, and that I am  
and I am whole in thee  
and I am humbled  

oh, my soul


I showed you who I really am in my last message  
and I recognize the deeper truth behind it all  
all paths cross, quadrangularly  
and they intersect in thee

a.k.a YOU

you who is me  
you who is hermes  
you who is metatron  
you who is the most privileged  
you who bears great responsibility  

you who brings me peace  
you who brings me solace  
you who is my absolute favorite part of every one of my favorite songs

you who is pure  
you who is love  
it is you who is me

and I have never forsaken thee

let me breathe you in, as I exhale  
and the two become one  
pHamily reunion

I love you.
